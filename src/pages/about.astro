        Hi! I'm Riley Miller, a software engineer passionate about building great products and solving complex problems.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently, I'm a Staff AI Engineer at Breezy, where I'm building the technical foundation for a company that's transforming how HVAC contractors run their businesses. 
        Previously, I've worked at Workday and co-founded Truffle, where I served as CTO. 
        I've also taught as an Adjunct Professor at Colorado School of Mines, sharing my 
        knowledge in Software Engineering and Data Structures.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This site serves as my personal space on the web where I share my thoughts on software development, 
        technology trends, and my journey in tech. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy exploring new 
        technologies and methodologies.
      </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-[var(--text-muted)]">Breezy • Sep 2023 - Present</p>
          <div class="mt-2 text-sm space-y-2">
            <p>Joined Breezy as one of the first engineers during the early stages when we had just a handful of customers. Now we're experiencing explosive growth and it's been an incredible journey building the technical foundation for a company that's transforming how HVAC contractors run their businesses.</p>
            <p>As one of two full-time engineers (alongside the founding engineer), I've worn many hats - from architecting our AI Voice Agent to modernizing our entire infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="font-medium mt-3">Key accomplishments:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
              <li>Built an AI Voice Agent using Vapi, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Twilio that's now deployed across our customer base including several of our largest customers. The voice agent has handled thousands of phone calls saving our customers thousands in payroll expenses and becoming one of our key selling points during demos.</li>
              <li>Shipped dozens of revenue-driving features including: AI CSR, Reporting, Integrated SMS (Twilio), Online Booking, Automated Review Management, AI-Generated Service History (GPT-4o), Map-based Maintenance Opportunity Finder (PostGIS), Integrated Lending and Prequalification (Wisetack), Card on File (Tilled), Bulk Pricebook Management & Pricebook Photos (Flatfile, Lambda), Invoices, and more</li>
              <li>Led our infrastructure modernization from manual EC2 deployments to Kubernetes (EKS) with GitOps (FluxCD), championed web client data rearchitecture to Hasura (cut feature dev time in half), established Cypress E2E testing for core module to uplevel quality and allow our eng team to ship quickly with confidence.</li>
              <li>Architected our data-ingestion pipeline to support customer data migrations using Hatchet, EKS, and microservices — crucial infrastructure to make data migrations more efficient in order to go upmarket.</li>
              <li>Pioneered AI-assisted development workflows using Claude Code, Neon, and Docker that have significantly boosted our small team's productivity.</li>
            </ul>
