Welcome to my learning list, this document will hold different topics that I'm learning or interested in learning
and allow me to keep track of all of my notes and learning content.

 In essence, the ultimate purpose of this page is to track my _dabbling_ and _breadth-based learning_ until I decide to narrow my focus and set aside time for an [Ultra Learning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2016/07/28/ultralearn-diy-1/) project.

## Feynman Technique
I'm also planning on using the [Feynman technique](../feynman-technique) to help learn new topics. The Feynman technique
focuses on two types of knowledge: **knowing the name of something** vs. **understanding something**.
