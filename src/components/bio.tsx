      Hi Friends
        </p>

    <p>
      My name is Riley Miller and welcome to my digital garden.
        </p>

    <p>
      I am a skilled Software Engineer, Professor, Researcher, Co-founder, former college football player, and English Bulldog Dad. </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently working full-time as a Software Engineer for Workday, teaching as an adjunct faculty member for Colorado School of Mines, and kickstarting my own company LiveLot‚Äîa real-time
      parking management platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also recently finished up my Masters degree in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines where I worked as a Graduate Teaching Fellow
      and Graduate Research Assistant while I wrote <a href="https://mountainscholar.org/handle/11124/174131"> my thesis </a> on applied Machine Learning for <a href="https://www.mturk.com/worker/help">crowdsourcing</a>
      {` `} platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason for this site: <b>I'm a teacher, and I'm <i>extremely</i> passionate about learning.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my greatest passions in life is to teach others what I'm passionate about whether that be my faith,
      software development, personal finance, or how to protect the quarterback. I believe that learning is one of the
      richest aspects of the human experience and I hope that this site will help others expand their knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>The idea behind structuring this site as a <a target={`_blank`}
      href={`https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden`}>Digital Garden</a> is to reduce the formality behind a lot of my writing. I don't want any of the content
      that I write on this site to be viewed as a "finished work". Treating this site as a digital garden will allow me to come back and improve previously
      written content as I expand my ideas or think of a better way to articulate a topic.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work with a lot of different technologies during the course of my week and have worked with many others in the past. I'm currently interested in TypeScript, React,
      React Native, Jenkins, Docker, C++, Bash, JavaScript Testing (Jest, Cypress, @testing-library), TensorFlow, Node.js, Python, and Arch Linux.
