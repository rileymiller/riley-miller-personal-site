A personal goal of mine is to go work at a FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) company since I love
CS and these companies are considered to hire the most talented engineers. I strive to be one.

This document will hold my plan for preparing for interviews, links to topics I've learned to prepare, as well 
as document my experience of interviewing at these companies.
