description: How to get setup with Saros and Eclipse
---

For the section of Software Engineering that I'm teaching at Colorado School of Mines we
are using Eclipse as our IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write Java. My section is
in person at 5pm and to facilitate the bulk of the pair programming that we will be doing this
semester we are using an Eclipse plugin called Saros.

Saros is an Eclipse plugin that allows developers to turn Eclipse into a collaborative IDE. The technology
is very useful and has fit our use case but we've had some issues getting students setup and able to use
Saros.

This guide is meant to help students or anyone else who is thinking about using Saros and Eclipse
for pair programming sessions.

I'll be taking you how to get setup with Saros and assume that you have already installed Eclipse on your 
computer. I'm also using a 2017 MacBook Pro on Catalina for comparisons sake, although from what I've observed from
my students getting Saros setup is fairly Operating System agnostic.
