  In the past I wrote some articles while I was an adjunct prof at Colorado School of Mines. Enjoy!

      I just finished teaching a section of Software Engineering at Mines this fall as an Adjunct Professor and have recently created
      some content for teaching SOLID principles. In the SOLID principles assignments below 👇, students create a lightweight API in Spring
      Boot to manage their imaginary digital wallets 💸.
